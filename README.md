## Hi there! 👋

My name is Barbara, and I am a Manual QA Engineer with over 13 years of experience ensuring software quality in startups, enterprises, and global Agile teams. 
I have experience in scenarios where QA processes are already implemented, and also in building QA processes from scratch. 



💪🏻 Key strengths include:<br>
* Manual Testing: Web, Mobile, API, Database<br>
* Test Case Design, Execution & Documentation<br>
* Regression testing | Exploratory testing | Black box testing | White box testing | User acceptance testing<br>
* Agile / Scrum Methodologies<br>
* Defect Tracking & Root Cause Analysis (Jira, Confluence, Git)<br>
* API Testing (Postman) & SQL Queries for Data Validation<br>



🌱 I’m currently learning/improving my skills on:<br>
* Python<br>
* Selenium<br>
* Playwright<br>
* API testing with Postman<br>



⚡I have a proven record of reducing defect leakage, improving release quality, and boosting stakeholders confidence. Beyond execution, I focus on quality advocacy — mentoring peers on testing best practices and ensuring quality is embedded at every stage of delivery.
